** Fundamental Principles of Security
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CISSP_MONTH: January
   :END:
*** AIC Triad: 
**** Availability - reliable and timely access
Controls: eg. RAIDs, clustering, load balancing, redundancy, backups, secondary facilities, rollback, failover
**** Integrity - assurance of accuracy and reliability
Controls: eg. Hashing, Configuration Mgmt., Change controls, Access controls, Software digital signing, CRC checks
**** Confidentiality - necessary level of secrecy
Controls: eg. Encryption, Access controls
*** Risk Definitions:
- Vulnerability :: weakness in a system
- threat :: potential danger
- risk :: likelihood of threat source exploiting a vulnerability X the business impact
- exposure :: an instance of being exposed to losses
- control :: countermeasure, safeguard, to mitigate risk
*** Control Types:
- Administrative :: security documentation, risk management, training
- Technical :: logical controls, software, hardware, firewalls, IDS, encryption
- Physical :: guards, locks, fencing, lighting
*** Defense in Depth - layered 
- We use a slide to represent this concept across all control types
*** Control Functionalities:
- Preventative :: avoid incident
- Detective :: Identify an incident
- Corrective :: Fix
- Deterrent :: Discourage an attack
- Recovery :: Bring back to regular operations
- Compensating :: Provide an alternative measure of control 
**** Note that NIST CSF is closely organized along these lines, although slightly different
**** There is significant argument as to where companies should focus: preventative, or detective and recovery? 
- You should be able to voice when one approach is better than another.
- See Table 1-1 for Control Types X Control Functionalities
** Security Frameworks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       sn0bk3g0wih0
   :CISSP_MONTH: January
   :END:
*** Security Program Development:
- ISO/IEC 27000 series 
  -- Understand history and how series docs are related
*** Enterprise Architecture Development:
- Zachman Framework - enterprise architecture
- TOGAF - Open Group - enterprise architecture - probably the most relevant to large corporations
- DoDAF - US military
- MODAF - British MoD
- SABSA - security architecture focus
**** An architecture is a set of different organizational views (Figure 1-4)
**** An ISMS is implemented through a Security Architecture - it helps prevent the issues listed in this section 
- our risk framework is a version of a security architecture. Compared risk framework to Table 1-3.
- "The architecture is a tool used to ensure that what is outlined in security standards is implemented throughout the different layers of an organization" - this is where the applicability matrix start to come into play.
**** Successful security architecture requires:
- Strategic alignment :: business drivers, regulatory and legal requirements are being meta
- Business enablement :: security supports business, risk is necessary
- Process Enhancement :: security tools can offer the opportunity to automate and streamline processes
- Security Effectiveness :: metrics, SLA, ROI
*** Security Controls Development:
**** COBIT 5 - IT Management Framework - ISACA
- Focuses on optimizing Value of IT - beyond just security
- Key feature is a separation of governance from management, and goal breakdown
- Goals: 17 enterprise and 17 IT-related goals (clearly very generic to apply to all companies)
- COBIT introduced the concept of "control objectives", "controls", and "control tests".
- COBIT 5 got rid of "controls objectives".
- The Audit industry is largely based off COBIT.
**** NIST SP 800-53 - NIST controls
- NIST lives in the Dept. of Commerce
- FISMA (Federal Informatin Security Management Action) requires agencies to follow NIST
**** COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework - financial fraud focus
- COBIT came from COSO
- Used for Corporate Governance (whereas COBIT is IT governance)
- SOX (2002) is based on COSO, thus following COSO can ensure compliance with SOX
*** Process Management Development:
**** ITIL - IT processes - UK origin
- IT service management
- Focused on internal SLAs between IT and the Business
**** Six Sigma 
- Based on Total Quality Management (TQM)
- All about operation efficiency, reducing variation, defects, waste (very manufacturing oriented)
**** Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)
- Carnegie Mellon
- Started the idea of processes maturity levels (that are now starting to fade in popularity)
- This model is still heavily influential (FFIEC and NIST assessment tools both have resemblances to it)
- Also, it mimics how infosec is slowly improved each year 
*** Security Program Lifecycle
**** Plan and Organized
**** Implement
**** Operate and Maintain
**** Monitor and Evaluate
- Notice Figure 1-8 is closely aligned with our model
*** Functionality vs. Security
** Crime Laws
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CISSP_MONTH: January
   :END:
*** Computer-assisted - crime could take place even without a computer
*** Computer-targeted - crime could not take place
*** Computer is incidental - computer just happened to be involved
** Complexities:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CISSP_MONTH: January
   :END:
- Hard to ID attackers
- Lack of reporting
*** Evolution of attacks
- Today is much more profit driven
- See Verizon Breach report for 2016
- Types:
  - Script Kiddies
  - APT - nation state
*** International issues
**** Council of Europe Convention on CyberCrime
  -- First attempt to create an international response standards
**** OECD - Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data
  The are very similar to privacy principles
  - Collection Limitation
  - Data Quality
  - Purpose Specification
  - Use Limitation
  - Openness
  - Individual Participation
  - Accountability
**** EU Data Protection Directive - strict EU rules on privacy
  - US-based companies used to use Safe Harbor Privacy Principles
  - This has since been renegotiated
  - Safe Harbor Principles:
    - Notice
    - Choice
    - Onward Transfer
    - Security
    - Data Integrity
    - Access
    - Enforcement
  - Privacy shield Replaces Safe Harbor
    https://www.privacyshield.gov/Program-Overview
**** Import Export Requirements
- Wassenaar Arrangement - export controls restricting arms and dual-use goods exporting to certain controls
  - Cryptography can fall into a controlled export
- China, Russia, Iran, Iraq, etc. have crypto import controls to prevent citizen use
*****
*** Types of Legal Systems
**** Civil (Code) Law System
- France, Spain
- Rule based, non precedent based
- Most common around world and in Europe
- Lower courts not compelled to following decisions made by higher courts
**** Common Law System
- Developed in England, US uses
- Uses precedent
- Criminal, civil/tortued, administrative
- Civil - wrongs against individual or company resulting in damage or loss. Jury decides "liability", not innocence or guilt. Typically derrived from common law, case law. 
- Criminal - conduct violates government laws. Jail, fines. Derrived from statutes.
- Administrative/regulatory law - deals with regulatory standards. 
**** Customary Law Systems
- Personal conduct and behavior
- Based on traditions and customs
- Used in mixed legal systems (China, India)
**** Religious Law Systems
** Intellectual Property 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CISSP_MONTH: January
   :END:
- Companies must implement safeguards to protect IP, show that it exercised due care.
- Trade Secret
  - Resource must provide the company with some type of competitive value or advantage
  - Proprietary
  - NDA - promise not to share trade secrets. This gives company right to fire, and bring charges.
- Copyright
  - Gives right to control distribution, reproduction display and adapation of original work.
  - It protects the _expression_ of a resource, not the resource itself
  - Copyright is weaker than a patent
  - Copyright is much longer (life plus 50 years)
- Trademark
  - Used to protect a word, name, symbol, sound, shape, color, or combination.
  - Used to protect Brand.
  - International trademark law overseen by World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), part of the UN
- Patent
  - Grants legal ownership and ability to exclude others from using or copying an invention
  - Invention must be novel, useful and not obvious
  - Usually a 20 year period
  - Strongest form of protection
  - Large amount of patent litigation - main reason is Nonpracticing Entities (NPEs) or patent trolls. 
*** International Protection of Intellectual Property
- Resources protected by law should be part of data classification scheme, and properly protected with access controls
- Failure to protect could mean the data is not protected by law because it failed to practice due care.
*** Software Piracy
**** Types of licencing
- Freeware
- Shareware
- Commercial
- Academic
**** EULA
more granular that Master
**** Master Agreement
**** International
- Not a crime everywhere
- Federation Against Software Theft (FAST) and the Business Software Alliance promote enforcement of proprietary rights of software
**** Security Implictaions
- Common offense is to reverse engineer code. But this is necessary for discover security flaws.
- Can be prosecuted for reverse engineering code under Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
- DMCA - criminalizes production and dissemination of technology that circumvents access control measures.
- EU has similar law called Copyright Directive

**** Tiers:
- Organizational - business as a whole
- Business process - risk to major functions
- Information systems - IT risk
*** Information Systems Risk Management Policy
- Defines approach to IT risk - should be connected to Enterprise Risk approach
- Topics:
  - Objectives
  - Acceptable level of risk
  - Risk identification process
  - Connected to strategic planning
  - Roles and responsibilities** - key part as it leads to implementation
  - Mapping of risk to controls
  - resource allocation approach
  - Mapping of risks to targets and budget
  - Key indicators

Note: those topics are typically to low detail to actually go in a policy. 
*** Process
- NIST 800-39
**** Frame risk - define the context
**** Assess risk - set the likelihood and impact scales for each risk identified
**** Respond to risk - accept, mitigate, transfer - explicit decision required
**** Monitor risk - monitor control effectiveness
*** Threat Modeling
- See threat modeling spreadsheet as a simple approach
*** Vulnerabilities
*** Information
- Data at rest
- Data in motion
- Data in use - race conditions
*** Processes
*** People
- Social Engineering
- Social networks
- Passwords!
*** Threats
*** Attacks
- Attackers think in graphs, security personnel think in checklists
- Figure 1-14 - an attack tree
- Attack kill chain: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_chain
*** Reduction Analysis
- Vulnerability - Threat - Attack triad can be risk assessed
- Ideally have a control for each node in the attack tree
- Controls at the root of the tree will defend against a broader array of attack triads
- 
** Risk Assessment and Analysis
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CISSP_MONTH: January
   :END:
*** Identifying risks
- simple approach: Asset at Risk X Threat Community X Threat Type X Effect
*** Generic process (NIST)
**** Prepare for the assessment
**** Conduct the assessment
***** Identify threat sources and events
***** Identify vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions
***** Determine likelihood of occurence
***** Determine magnitude of impact
***** Determine risk
**** Communicate results
**** Maintain assessment
*** Facilitated Risk Analysis Process (FRAP)
- Qualitative, member experience driven
- No annual loss expectancy values or probability numbers
- Small scope - single system
*** OCTAVE
- use facilitated workshops
- self-directed team approach
- Much wider scope of FRAP
*** AS/NZS 4360
- Australia and New Zealand
- Very broad risk appraoch
*** ISO/IEC 27005 
- International risk management standard
- Deals with IT and softer security issues (documentation, personnel security, training, etc)
*** Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA)
- product development
- Failure of products or software
*** Fault tree analysis
- Figure 1-15
*** Central Computing and Teecmmunications Agency Risk Analysis and Management Method (CRAMM)
- UK
- basic risk methodology in an automated tools
*** Difference:
- Organization wide: ISO/IEC 27005 or Octave
- IT Risk: NIST SP 800-30
- Limited budget/focused assessment: FRAP
- Software engineering: FMEA, Fault Tree
- Business perspective: AS/NZS 4360
*** Approaches
- Qualitative
- Quantitative
*** Quantitative
- Asset Value X Exposure Factor (EF) = Single Loss Expectancy
- Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) = SLE x Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
*** Qualitative
- use the High Medium Low Matrices
*** Control Selection
- Risk analysis allows a cost-benefit analysis
- ROSI: ((Risk Exposure * % Mitigate) - Solution Cost) / Solution Cost
- ALE before controls - ALE after controls - annual cost = value of control
*** Risk terms:
- Inherent risk - beginning risk
- Residual risk - remaining risk 
*** Handling Risk:
- Avoid
- Accept
- Transfer
- Mitigate
*** Outsourcing
- You can't outsource risk responsibility
** Risk Management Frameworks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CISSP_MONTH: February
   :END:
- "a structured process that allows an organization to identify and assess risk, reduces it to an acceptable level, and ensure that it remains at that level."
- Commonly accepted Frameworks:
  - NIST RMF (SP 800-37r1) - Required for federal government agencies - focused on information systems.
  - ISO 31000:2009 - international standard - not focused on Information systems, can be applied broadly in an organization.
  - ISACA Risk IT - aims to bridge gap between generic framework like ISO 31000, and IT-centric ones likes NIST. Integrated with COBIT.
  - COSO Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework - 2004 - generic, top-down approach, can be thought of as a superset of the COSO Internal Control framework 
*** Categorize Information Systems
- Identify systems, subsystems, and boundaries
- Related Business processes
- Integration with Enterprise architecture
- Types of information, it's criticality
- Regulatory and legal requirements applicable
- System interconnections 
*** Select Security Controls
- Assumes that you have performed a risk assessment and have identified a number of common controls across the organization
- For new systems, must determine if there any risks specific to the systems
- Can then either modify common controls (hybrid controls) or develop brand newer ones (system-specific controls)
- Baseline controls = common controls, Actual controls are the hybrid and systems-specific controls 
*** Implement Security Controls
- Implement the control
- Document the control
*** Assess Security Controls
- Assessor must be competent and independent
- Asses whether controls are effective
- If not effective, document findings and remediation actions
*** Authorize Information Systems
- Person must determine whether the risk exposure is acceptable to the organization. For a new system this will authorize connecting it to the network. For an inplace system, this is accepting risk or the mitigation plans.
*** Monitor Security Controls
- Ongoing monitoring and continuous improvement
- Look for new tactics, techniques and procedures of adversary, new vulnerabilities, system changes
** Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CISSP_MONTH: February
   :END:
Goal: minimize effects of a disaster or disruption
Continuity planning - focused on the longer term procedures for dealing with outages and disasters, typically focused on Senior Management and Business Lines
Disaster Recovery Plan - short-term, typically very IT focused, typically focused on Business Lines and Application Availability
Business Continuity Management - the holistic process that covers both of the above terms, considers Availability, Reliability, and Recoverability
Common issue is security not being considered:
- servers in backup data center not physically secured
- emergency remote access services with insufficient encryption
Or - it's too secure and emergency actions cannot take place:
- admins cannot access servers because PAM system is inoperable, or manager approval cannot take place due to networking issues
- the term "break glass account" typically refer to providing the ability to bypass controls in case of an emergency situation

Business Continuity Planning:
- Protect lives, safety
- Reduce business impact
- Resume critical functions
- Work with outside vendors and partners
- Reduce confusion
- Ensure suitability of business
- Get "up and running"

*** Standards and Best Practices
NIST SP 800-34 R1 "Continuity Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems"

1. Develop the continuity planning policy statement
   Provides guidance and authority
2. Conduct the business impact analysis (BIA)
   - Identify critical functions
   - Identify vulnerabilities, threats, calculate risks
3. Identify preventive controls
   - Identify and implement controls to reduce risk
4. Create contingency strategies
   - Methods to brings systems online quickly
5. Develop an information system contingency plan
   - How to stay functional in a crippled state
6. Ensure plan testing, training, and exercises
7. Ensure plan maintenance

Others:
- ISO/IEC 27031:2011 - information and communication technology readiness
- ISO 22301:2012 - Business continuity management systems. Can be certified against this document.
- Business Continuity Institute's Good Practice Guidelines (GPG)
  - Management Practices
  - Technical Practices
- DRI International Institute's Professional Practices for Business Continuity Planners

*** Making BCM Part of teh Enterprise Security Program
- Zachman Business Enterprise Framework - used to understand a company's architecture and all the pieces and parts that make it up, looks at various requirements of business processes. Looks at: data, function, network, people, time and motivation components.
- Ideally, BCM should be part of the security program and business decisions and not carved off by itself
- Ideally report to a senior executive with strong management support
- Should understand the Why of the business. For most companies, it is to make money. Not so for government, non-profit. 
*** BCP Project Components
- Identify a Business Continuity Coordinator - leader of the team, typically must be strong at horizontal leadership
- BCP Committee - must be familiar with each department (business units, senior management, IT, Security, Communications, Legal)
- Setting up budget and staff
- Assigning duties and responsibilities
- Senior management kick-off
- Awareness-raising activities
- Training
- Data collection to support continuity options
- Quick-wins
*** Scope of the Project
- Typically scoped to larger threats with smaller threats convered by independent departmental contingency plans
*** BCP Policy
- supplies the framework for and governance of designing and building the BCP effort
- Contents: Scope, mission statement, principles, guidelines and standards
- Steps to create:
  - Identify and document the components of the policy
  - Identify and define policies of the organization that the BCP might affect
  - Identify pertinent legislation, laws, regulations and standards
  - Identify "good industry practice" guidelines
  - Perform a gap analysis
  - Compose a draft
  - Review draft
  - Incorporate feedback
  - Get approval
  - Publish
*** Project Management
- Basically - execute a BCP project like any other good project
- SWOT - strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
- Project Plan:
  - Objective-to-task mapping
  - Resource to task mapping
  - Workflows
  - Milestones
  - Deliverance  - Budget Estimates
  - Success Factors
  - Deadlines
*** BCP Requirements
- Need management support to get necessary resources
- Executives must provide due diligence: doing everything within one's power to prevent a bad thing from happening
- Due care: taking the precautions that a reasonable and competent person would take in the same situation
- Regulations require customer data be protected even during a disaster
*** Business Impact Analysis
- a functional analysis - what are the functions of the business and what is their criticality. Point is to identify the areas that would suffer the greatest financial or operational loss. 
- Must identify:
  - Max tolerable downtime
  - Operational disruption and productivity
  - Financial considerations
  - Regulatory resposibilities
  - Reputation
- This is gather through SME interviews, develop process flow diagrams

BIA Steps:
- Select individuals to interview
- Create data-gathering techniques (surveys)
- Identify critical business functions
- Identify dependent resources
- Calculate how long functions can survive without the resources
- Identify vulnerabilities and threats to these functions
- Calculate risk for each function
- Document findigns
**** Risk Assessment
- A BCP focused assessment should be conducted
**** Risk Assessment Evaluation and Process
- Set the Likelihood and Impact for disruption threats
**** Assigning Values to Assets
- Cost of a loss (impact)
- Maximum tolerable Downtime (MTD), Maximum Period Time of Disruption (MPTD). Examples:
  - Non-essential functions: 30 days
  - Normal: 7 days
  - Important: 72 hours
  - Urgent: 24 hours
  - Critical: Minutes to hours
*** Interdependencies
** Personnel Security
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CISSP_MONTH: February
   :END:
Separation of Duties :: make sure that one individual cannot complete a critical task by his/herself. Two variations:
Split knowledge :: No one person knows all the details
Dual control :: Two individuals are required to complete the task
Rotation of duties :: used to uncover fraudulent activities, mandatory vacations
*** Hiring Practices
Nondisclosure Agreements (NDAs) :: should be required
References should be checked
*** Termination
Companies should have a set procedure
Procedure should be connected to disabling account access
*** Security-Awareness Training
Should be comprehensive, tailored and organization-wide
Typically three audiences: Management, Staff, technical employees
Typically should require employees to sign stating understanding of their security responsibilities 

*** Degree or Certification?
Awareness :: provide information, goal is recognition and retention
Training :: provide knowledge, goal is providing a skill
Education :: provide Insight, goal is Understanding
** Security Governance
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CISSP_MONTH: February
   :END:
Security Governance :: A framework that allows for the security goals of an organization to be set and expressed by senior management
Goal is to implement security throughout the organization
*** Metrics
The means to facilitate decision making, perofrmance improvement and accountability
Must be quantitative, repeatable, reliable and meaningful
Balanced score card - a standard business metrics framework (not too common within security though)
- Financial, Internal Business, Learning and Growth, Customer

Note: Getting the right metrics is hard. Too common for business to default to measuring the data they have (# of IDS alerts) rather than those that express progress towards their security objectives. 

Industry best practices:
- ISO/IEC 27004:2009 - base measures, derived measures, indicator values
- NIST SP 800-55 R1 - implementation, effectiveness/efficiency, impact values

Metrics must mature as the program matures

Time Entry -> Compromise
Time Compromise -> Detection

** Computer Architecture
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CISSP_MONTH: March
   :END:
   - Computer Architecture :: all the parts of a computer system that are necessary for it to function, including the central processing unit, memory chips, logic circuits, storage devices, input and output devices, security components, buses, and networking interfaces. 
*** The Central Processing Unit
    - CPU :: brain of the computer
    - register :: temporary storage within CPU
    - arithmetic logic unit :: actual execution of instructions 
    - control unit :: manages and synchronizes the system while different applications' code and OS instructions are being executed
    - General registers :: holds variables and temporary results as ALU works through execution steps
    - special registers :: special information such as program counters, stack pointer, program status work (PSW)
    - program counter :: memory address of the next instruction to be fetched
    - program status word :: holds different condition bits - user mode, privileged mode. Privileged mode has access to more functions. 
    - memory has specific memory addresses. 
    - Memory bus - can be 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits wide. Most today are 64. 2^64 address space. 
*** Multiprocessing
    - More than one processor
    - symmetric mode - like load-balancing
    - asymmetric mode - processor dedicated to a task 
*** Memory Types
    - Random Access Memory (RAM) :: temporary storage. DRAM - must be refreshed, slower. Static RAM (SRAM) - does not require refresh, require more transistors, faster than DRAM
      - Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) :: synchronizes with the system's CPU clock - increases speed
      - Extended data out DRAM (EDO DRAM) :: faster than DRAM can capture next block while first block is being sent to CPU (look ahead)
      - Burst EDO DRAM (BEDO DRAM) :: Can send more data at once
      - Double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM) :: Carries out two operations per clock cycle, twice the throughput
      - Hardware segmentation :: physically segregating hardware between processes instead of just logically
    - Read-Only Memory :: non-volatile memory
      - Programmable read-only memory (PROM) :: can be modified after manufacture
        - Erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) :: can be erased, modified and upgraded.
        - Elecrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) :: can be erased and modified electrically (no UV light wand)
        - Flash memory :: was special type of memory used in digital cameras, BIOS chips, memory cards, video game consoles. Solid state. Now in computer hard drives.
    - Cache Memory :: used for high speed writing and reading activities - for caching data for easy access
    - Memory mapping :: software uses logical addresses, CPU uses physical addresses (absolute addresses). A security feature. Relative addresses: known address with an offset.
    - Buffer Overflows :: when too much data is accepted as input to a specific process. Buffer :: allocated segment of memory.

*** Memory Protection Techniques
    - Address space layout randomization (ASLR) - changes address layout randomly
    - Data Execution Prevention (DEP) - executable code does not function within memory segments that could be dangerous
*** Memory Leaks
    - When applications to correctly release memory. Can open the door to a DoS attack. 
** Operating Systems
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CISSP_MONTH: March
   :END:
*** Process Management
    - Process :: set of instructions that is actually running. A program loaded into memory. A process has computer resources (CPU, memory) assigned to it.
    - Multiprogramming :: More than one program can be loaded into memory at the same time. Legacy term.
    - Multitasking :: more than one application and the OS can handle requests from these applications simultaneously
    - Cooperative multitasking :: required the process to voluntarily release resources
    - premptive multitasking :: all modern OSes, the OS controls how long a process can use resources
    - spawning :: when a process creates a child process
    - running state :: CPU is executing its instructions
    - blocked state :: on hold
    - process table :: one entry per process - process state, stack pointer, memory allocation, program counter, status of open files
    - interrupts :: request for CPU time. Uses process priority levels.
      - maskable interupt :: low priority
      - nonmaskable interupt :: cannot be overridden by an application
    - stack :: each process has its own memory setack (Last in First Out LIFO)
    - thread :: a sub-process effectively. Executed in parallel.
    - process scheduling :: can be exploited to starve system of memory (DOS). Software deadlock :: processes are waiting on each other.
    - Process Activity :: ensuring only one process is access resources (memory/files) at a time. Process isolation. Means to enforce: encapsulation of objects, time multiplexing of shared resources, naming distinctions, virtual memory mapping. Encapsulation provides data hiding, processes communicate through an API. Time multiplexing, means of sharing the CPU. Naming distinctions - unique PID values. Virtual address memory mapping - logical vs. physical. Each application usually starts with 0. 
*** Memory Management
    - Abstraction :: details are hidden to the applications.
    - Memory manager :: allocate and deallocate different memory segments.
      - Relocation - swap hard drive / RAM, provide pointers to appications
      - Protection - limit processes to only access the memory assigned to them, provide access control to memory segments
      - Sharing - provide integrity and confidentiality when processes share memory segments, allow users to share an application
      - Logical organization - provide an abstracted addressing scheme, allow for sharing of software modules such as DLLs
      - Physical organization - segment physical memory space
    - Base register :: beginning address assigned to a process
    - Limit register :: ending address - describes the bounds of the process.
    - Virtual Memory :: uses secondary storage. Swap space. Security issue is that data on disk could potentially be captured, especially if swap space is not appropriately wiped. Consider: an encrypted file is opened, and hence decrypted. The unencrpted file in memory is then written to swap space. An attacker could then find means to access the file within the swap space. 
*** Input/Output Device Management
    - Interrupts :: Request for CPU time
    - Programmale I/O :: sends data to I/O device and polls the device to see if it is ready to accept more data. Can waste the CPUs time.
    - Interrupt-Driven I/O :: Device sends an interrupt when its ready. Have to deal with a lot of interrupts.
    - I/O using DMA :: Direct Memory Access - can transfer data without using the CPU. Significant speed advantages.
    - Premapped I/O :: CPU sends physical memory address to I/O device, I/O device must be trusted to access memory correctly.
    - Fully mapped I/O :: OS does not trust device, uses logical addresses
*** CPU Architecture Integration
    - instruction set :: the language of the CPU - x86 is most common in use today. 
    - microarchitecture :: makes up the CPU - registers, logic gates, ALU, cache, etc.
    - Rings :: protection system of the OS - levels of trust for processes - kernel runs in Ring 0, other OS components in Ring 1, Drivers/utilities in Ring 2, Applications in Ring 3. Lower level processes can access high level processes. Windows and OS X don't use Rings 1 adn 2.
    - Application Programming Interface (API) :: means for software to communicate with each other.
    - CPU Operations Modes :: Ring 0 is Kernel Mode, Ring 3 is User mode. 
*** Operating System Architectures
    - Monolithic architecture :: all the OS processes work in kernel mode. MS-DOS and early OSes like this.
    - Layered operating system :: all still work in kernel mode, functionality was laid out into layers that called on each other. Provides data hiding. Think kernel modules of DLLs in windows.
    - Microkernel model :: only a subset of critical kernel processes operating in kernel mode. Others in user mode. This introduced some performance issues.
    - Hybrid microkernel :: client server type architecture where applications are the clients. All of OS operates in kernel mode. 
*** Virtual Machines
    - Enables a single hardware to run multiple operating systems
    - Hypervisor :: manages the system resources between OSes

    - Trusted Path :: communication channel between user, program and TCB
    - Trusted shell :: a user cannot "bust out of it"
    - Security Perimeter :: divides trusted from untested - requires an interface
    - Reference Monitor :: defines how access control within a system is carried out

** Security Models
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CISSP_MONTH: March
   :END:
*** Bell-LaPadula Model
    - First mathematical model. 
    - enforces confidentiality only. Its about protecting secrets. One of the first models developed in the 70s. Is a multilevel security system.
    - Simple security rule :: a subject at a given security level cannot read data that resides at a higher security level. No read up.
    - *-property rule :: a subject in a given security level cannot write information to a lower security level. No write down.
    - Strong star property rule :: a subject with both read and write capabilities can only perform both at the same security level. 
*** Biba Model
    - Addresses Integrity. Prevents data at any integrity level from flowing to a higher integrity level.
    - *-integrity axiom :: a subject cannot write data to an object at a higher integrity level. No write up.
    - Simple integrity axiom :: Cannot read from a lower integrity level. No read down.
    - Invocation property :: Subject cannot request service (invoke) at a higher integrity.  
    - Memorization tip: "Simple" is about reading. * is about writing. 
*** Clark-Wilson Model
    - Developed after Biba, different approach to protecting Integrity
    - Three goals: subjects can access objects only through authorized programs, separation of duties enforced, auditing is required. 
    - Focuses on well-formed transactions and separation of duties.
    - Transformation Procedures (TPs) :: programmed abstract operations (read, write, modify)
    - Constrained Data Items (CDIs) :: can be manipulated only by TPs
    - Unconstrained Data Items (UDIs) :: can be manipulated by users via primitive read/write operations
    - Integrity verification procedures (IVPs) :: Check the consistency of CDIs with external reality - audits the work done and validates integrity
*** Noninterference Model
    - Less concerned about the flow of data that what a subject knows about the state of the system.
    - A lower level entity should not be able to detect that an operation took place at a higher level of security. That would be a form of information leakage.
    - Covert channel :: a way to receive information in an unauthorized manner. Either storage or timing. 
*** Brew and Nash Model
    - Chinese wall model. A subject can write to an object if, and only if, the subject cannot read another object that is in a different dataset.
    - Provides dynamic access control and separation of duty controls / conflicts of interests. 
*** Graham-Denning Model
    - Shows how subjects and objeects should be created and deleted
    - defines a set of basic rights in terms of commands that a specific subject can execute on an object. Eight primitive protection rights/rules.
    - How to securely create/delete a object/subject
    - How to securely provide read/grant/delete/transfer access rights
*** Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman Model
    - Shows how a finite set of procedures can be available to edit the access rights of a subject
    - Access rights of subjects and the integrity of those rights.

    - Symmetric :: use symmetric keys (secret keys)
    - Asymmetric :: use public/private keys
*** Symmetric Cryptography
    - Sender and receiver must have same key. Distributing the keys is a problem. And large # of people requires 2^n keys. But they are very fast and hard to break.
    - Example algorithms:
      - Data Encryption Standard (DES)
      - Triple-DES (3DES)
      - Blowfish
      - International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)
      - RC4, RC5, RC6
      - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
*** Asymmetric Cryptography
    - Solves the key distribution problem, better scalable, can provide authentication and nonrepudiation
    - Much slower, mathematically intensive.
    - Examples:
      - RSA
      - ECC
      - El Gamal
      - DSA
*** Block and Stream Ciphers
    - Block cipher - message is divided into blocks
    - Stream - stream of bits, operation performed on each bit individually
    - Initialization Vectors (IVs) :: random values that are used with algorithms to ensure patterns are not created during the encryption process. 
*** Hybrid Encryption Methods
    - Asymmetric and Symmetric - both common. Use asymmetric to distribute symmetric keys.
    - Session key - a single-use symmetric key used to encrypt messages between two users.
** Types of Symmetric Systems
*** Data Encryption Standard
    - Originally 64 bit, became ANSI standard in 1978
    - AKA DEA
    - Cracked in 1998
    - Later replaced by the Rijndael algorithm as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
    - symmetric block encryption algorithm, 64 bit blocks, 64 bit key: 56 bit key + 8 bit parity
    - Modes:
      - Electronic Code Book (ECB)
        - For a given block of plaintext and a given key, the same block of cipher text is always produced
        - Lacks randomness
        - Fast, can be run in parallel, good for encrypting small amounts of data 
      - Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
        - Does not reveal a pattern, value of previous block is used to process next block
        - Use of different IV results in different cipher text
      - Cipher Feedback (CFB)
        - Simulates a stream cipher
      - Output Feedback (OFB)
        - Values for encrypting next block come from Keystream instead of Ciphertext as in CFB. This eliminates possible chaining of an error.
      - Counter (CTR)
        - Similar to OFB, uses an IV counter, ensures IV is unique, no chaining involved, thus can be done in parallel, performance is main reason for using.
    - Synchronous :: encrypt one bit at a time, key values are in sync with plaintext values
    - Asynchronous :: use previously generated output as input 
*** Triple-DES
    - 48 rounds of computations
    - Modes:
      - DES-EE3 :: 3 different keys, triple encrypted
      - DES-EDE3 :: 3 different keys, encrypted, decrypted, encrypted
      - DES-EEE2 :: same as EEE3, but only two keys, first and third use same key
      - DES-EDE2 :: same as EDE3, but only two keys, first and third use same key
*** Advanced Encryption Standard
    - 1997
    - Block sizes: 128, 192, 256 bit
    - 128 bits - 10 rounds
    - 192 bits - 12 rounds
    - 256 bits - 14
*** International Data Encryption Algorithm
    - Block cipher, 64 bit blocks divided into 16 smaller blocks, 8 rounds. Key is 128 bits.
    - Is faster than DES in software
    - Harder to break than DES due to its longer key size
    - Used in PGP, patented
*** Blowfish
    - Block cipher
    - 65 bit blocks
    - Key: 32 bits up to 448 bits
    - 16 rounds
    - Public domain
*** RC4
    - Stream cipher
    - Variable key size
    - Used in SSL, 802.11 WEP
    - Sometimes case ARC4 since RC4 is trademarked
    - Vulnerable to modification attacks
*** RC5
    - block cipher
    - Block sizes: 32, 64 or 128 bits
    - Key size up to 2,048 bits
    - Rounds up to 255
*** RC6
    - Block cipher, built on RC5
    - Faster than RC5
** Types of Asymmetric Systems
*** Diffie-Hellman Algorithm
    - key agreement algorithm
    - Allows two systems to generate a symmetric key securely
    - Vulnerable to man in the middle attacks if no authentication of users is done. RSA can be used to perform authentication.
*** RSA
    - Rivest, Shamir, Adleman
    - Can be used for digital signatures, key exchange and encryption
    - Provides authentication as well as encryption
    - Can be used as a key exchange protocol
*** El Gamal
    - Can be used for digital signatures, encryption and key exchange
    - Rather than factoring, based on calculating discrete logarithms in a finite field
    - Extension of Diffie-Hellman
    - Main drawback is performance
*** Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems
    - Digital signatures, secure key distribution, encryption
    - ECC is more efficient than RSA and other asymmetric algorithm 
*** Knapsack
    - Encryption, digital signature
    - Insecure, not in use 
*** Zero Knowledge Proof
    - when it's shown someone has the right private key, without making them present the private key 
** Message Integrity
*** The One-Way Hash
    - Takes a variable length string -> fixed-length hash value 
    - Value is the fact it is one-way
    - Hashing :: Provides Integrity. Not confidentiality or authentication. Detects only unintentional modifications. 
    - Message Authentication Code (MAC) :: an authentication scheme derived by applying a secret key to a message in some form
    - HMAC :: symmetric key is concatenated with message creating a MAC value. Provides Integrity and data origin authentication; confidentiality not provided.
    - CBC-MAC :: Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code - message encrypted with a symmetric block cipher in CBC mode, output of final block of ciphertext is used as the MAC. Provides Integrity and data origin authentication; confidentiality is not provided. 
                 Cipher-Based MAC - (CMAC) - more secure version of CBC-MAC. 
*** Various Hashing Algorithms
    - Strong hash functions:
      - Compute over the entire message
      - One-way function
      - Given a message and its hash value, computing another message with the same hash value should be impossible
      - Resistant to birthday attacks
      - Collision free 
*** MD4
    - 128-bit hash value
    - Not considered secure
*** MD5
    - 128 bit hash value, more complex than MD4
    - Subject to collision attacks thus not suitable for SSL certs and digital signatures. Still used for file integrity checksums. 
*** SHA
    - 160-bit hash value, used with Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
    - SHA1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 - update versions of SHA. SHA-1 is 160 bit.
    - SHA1 not considered secure, vulnerable to collisions. 
    - Designed by NSA, published by NIST. 
*** Attacks Against One-Way Hash Functions
    - Birthday attack :: a forced collision. Protect against with longer hashing values. 
*** Digital Signatures
    - A hash value that has been encrypted with the sender's private key.
    - Encryption provides confidentiality.
    - Hashing provides integrity.
    - Digital signature provides authentications, nonrepudiation and integrity
*** Digital Signature Standard
    - 1991, NIST
    - SHA used for hashing
    - DSA, RSA or ECDSA used for signing
** Public Key Infrastructure
   - An ISO authentication framework that uses public key cryptography and the X.509 standard.
*** Certificate Authorities
    - Credential containing the public key for that individual along with other identifying information.
    - Created and signed by a trusted third party (Certificate Authority)
    - Registration Authority :: verifies individuals identity
    - Cross Certification :: when two CAs establish a trust relationship
    - Certificate Revocation List (CRL) :: list of every revoked certificate. Lot of problems with this since applications do not always check them (such as browsers)
    - Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) :: Validates a certificate in the background, checks CRL.
*** Certificates
    - X.509 is the standard for creating a certificate. x.509v3 is most common (SSL uses this). 
    - Includes: serial number, version number, identity information, algorithm information, lifetime dates, signature of issuing authority.
*** The Registration Authority
    - Confirms identity of an individual, initiates certification process with a CA, acts as broker between user and CA
*** PKI Steps
** Key Management
*** Key Management Principles
    - Keys should be kept encrypted
    - Key distribution and maintenance should be automated
    - Protected against being lost, destroyed or corrupted by being backed up
    - May need key recovery services to allow administrators to access data encrypted by an individual
*** Rules for Keys and Key Management
    - Keys should be long enough to provide sufficient protection
    - Stored and transmitted securely
    - Should be extremely random, algorithm should use full spectrum of key space
    - Lifetime should correspond with sensitivity of data - more sensitive data should have shorter key lifetime
    - The more the key is used, the shorter its lifetime should be
    - Backup and escrow for emergencies. Escrow allows key recovery. 
    - Destroy at end of life 
** Trusted Platform Module
   - microchip installed on the motherboard, dedicated to storage and processing of keys, hashes and digital certs
*** TPM Uses
    - Most common is for encrypted hard disks
    - Sealing system state to particular hardware
    - TPM internal memory:
      - Persistent memory:
        - Endorsement Key (EK) :: public/private  key pair installed at time of manufacture, cannot be modified
        - Storage Root Key (SRK) :: master wrapping key used to secure keys stored in the TPM
      - Versatile Memory:
        - Attestation Identity Key (AIK) :: used for attestation of TPM chip to service providers. Ensures integrity of the EK.
        - Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) :: stores cryptographic hashes of data used for TPM sealing functionality
        - Storage keys :: use to encrypt storage media
** Attacks on Cryptography
*** Ciphertext-Only Attacks
    - hardest attack to execute 
*** Known-Plaintext Attacks
    - Attacker knows a portion o the plain text of the encrypted message 
*** Chosen-Plaintext Attacks
    - Attacker can choose the plaintext that gets encrypted to see corresponding cipher text 
*** Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks
    - Can choose the ciphertext to be decrypted and has access to the resulting decrypted plaintext 
*** Differential Cryptanalysis
    - Looks at cipher text pairs generated by plaintext pairs and analyzes the differences. Used to break DES. 
*** Linear Cryptanalysis
    - carries out a known-plaintext attack on several different messages encrypted with the same key. Raises probability of a specific key having been used.
*** Side-Channel Attacks
    - power consumption, radiation emissions, time (time analysis was used to pull private keys from RSA smartcards)
*** Replay Attacks
    - attacker resubmits data trying to fool receiving device
    - Timestamps and sequence numbers are two countermeasures to this
*** Algebraic Attacks
    - analyze vulnerabilities in the mathematics (RSA encryption of "0" is "0")
*** Analytic Attacks
    - identify algorithm structural weaknesses or flaws (Double DES attack, RSA factoring attack)
*** Statistical Attacks
    - identify statistical weaknesses in algorithm design, such as a biased random number generator
*** Social Engineering Attacks
    - trick people into providing their keys 
*** Meet-in-the-Middle Attacks
    - encrypting from one end and decrypting from the other end 
** Site and Facility Security
   - Threats:
     - Natural environmental threats
     - Supply system threats
     - Manmade threats
     - Politically motivated threats
   - Must be layered - moving from perimeter to asset
     - For example: fence, building walls, access control card, guard, an IDS, locked computer cases, safes
** The Site Planning Process
   - Define the objectives of the program, design the program, develop performance metrics, evaluation process
   - Should address the following goals:
     - Crime and disruption prevention through deterrence: fences, security guards, warning signs, etc.
     - Reduction of damage through delaying mechanisms: layers of defenses, locks, security personnel, barriers
     - Crime or disruption detection: smoke detectors, motion detectors, CCTV, etc.
     - Incident assessment: security guard response
     - Response procedures: fire suppression mechanisms, emergency response processes, law enforcement notification, consultation with outside security professionals
   - Possible performance metrics:
     - number of successful crimes
     - number of successful disruptions
     - number of unsuccessful crimes
     - number of unsuccessful disruptions
     - Time between detection, assessment and recovery
     - Business impact of disruptions
     - Number of false-positive detection alerts
     - Time it took for a criminal to defeat a control
     - Time it took to restore operational environment
     - Financial loss of a successful crime
     - Financial loss of a successful disruption
   - Basically - physically security requires a risk assessment process 
*** Crime Prevention through Environmental Design
    - Proper design of a physical environment can reduce crime by directly affecting human behavior
    - Landscaping, entrances, layouts, lighting, road placement, traffic patterns, etc.
    - The reason trees are removed from around a data center - removes hiding places.
    - Natural access control - controlling flow by placement of devices such as lighted bollards
    - Can create security zones
    - Natural surveillance - make criminal feel uncomfortable by providing many ways observers could see them - ex. use of open areas
    - Natural territorial reinforcement - use of walls, fences, landscaping lighting, flags, markings to create a sense of dedicated community 
*** Designing a Physical Security Program
    - Observe how facility is used
    - Comply with regulations
    - Legal issues known
    - Should have a facility safety officer
    - Create a plan
    - Facility:
      - consider visibility and noticablity
      - Closeness to emergency services
    - Construction:
      - evaluate construction materials
      - fire protection levels
      - load of walls, floors and ceiling
      - Windows: UV protection, shatterproof, opacity
      - Consider:
        - Walls - combustibility, fire rating, reinforcement

        - Electric power supplies - backup and alternative, clean and steady, dedicated feeders, placement
        - Water and gas lines - shutoff valves, positive flow, placement
        - Fire detection - placement of detectors, place of suppression systems, type of detectors and suppression systems
      - Entry points - consider secondary entry points: secondary doors, windows, fire escapes
      - Internal Compartments - can be circumvented through dropped ceilings
      - Computer and equipment rooms - should be restricted to minimum necessary personnel
        - Not located on high floors as inaccessible in case of fire. Not located in basements due to flooding, typically at core of building
        - water detectors under raised floors and on dropped ceilings
        - monitor humidity
        - separate electricity if possible, UPS, generators
** Protecting Assets
*** Protecting Mobile Devices
    - Inventory mobile devices to allow identification if recovered
    - Harden the OS
    - Password protect
    - Don't check as luggage

    - Thermal relocking - when a certain temperature is met (such as from drilling) extra lock is implemented
** Internal Support Systems
*** Electric Power
    - Protection: UPSs, power line conditioners, backup sources
    - EMI and RFI can create power interference. Power lines should not run over lighting as it can create interference.
    - Power excess: spike: momentary high voltage, surge: prolonged high voltage
    - Power loss: fault: momentary power outage, blackout: prolonged loss
    - Power degradation:
      - Sag/dip - momentary low-voltage
      - Brownout - prolonged low-voltage
      - In-rush current - initial surge of current
    - Voltage regulators and line conditioners can be used to ensure clean and smooth power distribution
    - Use surge protectors, line monitors, regulators, access controls, shielding, do not run over lights, three-prong connectors
*** Environmental Issues
    - Positive drains - contents flow out instead of in
    - Typical data center should have a separate HVAC
    - Appropriate temperature, humidity
*** Fire Prevention, Detection, and Suppression
    - Training employees
    - Right equipment
    - Fire detection
    - Fire suppression: sprinkler or CO2 discharge
    - Types: smoke activated, heat activated
    - Fire suppression
      - Class A - common combustibles, wood, paper, laminates. Suppress with water, foam

    - Ensure detectors are in plenum areas (drop spaces)
    - Water sprinklers
      - Wet pipe - always contain water. Can freeze in cold climates. Damage if nozzle breaks.
      - Dry pipe - water not held in pipes. Pipes charged with a smoke alarm is activated. Best in cold climates.
      - Preaction - Requires a head to melt before water is released.
      - Deluge - water released in large volumes.

** Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model
   "All People Seem to Need Data Processing"
*** Protocol
    - Actual protocol did not catch on as a standard, but the model is used as an abstract framework
    - TCP/IP model (developed before OSI):
      - Application
      - Host-to-Host
      - Internet
      - Network Acess
    - Uses encapsulation
*** Application Layer
    - Layer 7

*** Presentation Layer
    - Layer 6
    - Provides a common means of representing data, data compression, encryption
    - MIME, ASCII, EBCDIC, TIFF, JPEG, MPEG, MIDI
*** Session Layer
    - Layer 5
    - connection between applications
    - Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), PPTP, NetBIOS, RPC
    - three modes:
      - Simplex - one direction

    - Two sub-layers
      - Logical link control - IEEE 802.2, communicates directly with network layer, flow control and error checking
      - Media Access Control (MAC) -  Knows what type of network it is
        - Ethernet - IEEE 802.3
        - Token Ring - IEEE 802.5
